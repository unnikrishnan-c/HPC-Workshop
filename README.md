**GPU Programming With OpenMP 5.0**<br/>
Watch the  youtube video available <a href="https://youtu.be/p1ChaYDkIn0"> here</a>. The video gives an introduction to GPU Programming using OpenMP 5.0. 

Google Colaboratory provides free GPU access and is used as the programming platform in the video.
<br/> The video also points out few mistakes which first-time users may make. Please watch the video before the workshop day and get ready for the lab session.

**[`programs/`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/programs) folder**<br>

 The programs given in the video are available in the folder programs. 
 
 
 **[`tutorials/`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/tutorials) folder**<br>
 
 - The commands used in the video lecture are available in [`Commands_Used_In_Video.md`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/blob/main/tutorials/Commands_Used_In_Video.md).  
 
 - The presentation used in the video is available as [`OpenMP GPU Programming with Google Colab.pdf`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/blob/main/tutorials/OpenMP%20GPU%20Programming%20with%20Google%20Colab.pdf). 
 
 - The possible Linux commands which may be useful during lab session are marked with yellow color in the PDF file [`linux_commands.pdf`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/blob/main/tutorials/linux_commands.pdf). A subset of yellow-colored commands will be required for the lab session. 



**[`Examples_FN/`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/Examples_FN) folder**<br>

Example [`OpenMP`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/Examples_FN/OpenMP) and [`MPI`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/Examples_FN/MPI) programs to try out in the forenoon lab session.


**[`Examples_AN/`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/tree/main/Examples_AN) folder**<br>

Example `OpenMP GPU` programs to try out in the afternoon lab session. See [`Examples_AN/README.md`](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/blob/main/Examples_AN/README.md) for instructions on how to compile the examples. <br>


**Useful Online Resources**<br>
- The  **[`book`](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-examples-5.0.0.pdf)** has detailed explanation  of OpenMP 5.0 constructs with examples.

- The  **[`presentation`](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2018/presentation/s8344-openmp-on-gpus-first-experiences-and-best-practices.pdf)** compares OpenMP on CPU and GPU. It also explains how to write efficient  OpenMP programs for GPUs.

- Click  for **[FN Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uucY61yJlZs&t=1048s)**   and  **[AN Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KABbqwbBOiM&t=9030s)** recorded lectures.


**[ `Matrix Multiplication Example` ](https://github.com/unnikrishnan-c/HPC-Workshop/blob/main/matrixmul.zip)**<br>
 - The Matrix multiplication examples include serial program, different loop permutation and tiling for multi-core CPUs, CUDA and OpenMP 5.0 program for Nvidia GPUs.
