**GPU Programming With OpenMP 5.0**<br/>
Watch the  youtube video available <a href="https://youtu.be/p1ChaYDkIn0"> here</a>. The video gives an introduction to GPU Programming using OpenMP 5.0. 

Google Colaboratory provides free GPU access and is used as the programming platform in the video.
<br/> The video also points out few mistakes which first-time users may make. Please watch the video before the workshop day and get ready for the lab session.
